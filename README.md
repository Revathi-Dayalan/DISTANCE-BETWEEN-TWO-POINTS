# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: take two points as an input from an user
### Step 2: calculatr the corresponding between x and y
### Step 3: apply the formula
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: exit

### PROGRAM:
```
import math
x1=4
y1=2
x2=10
y2=6
d=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print(format(d,".2f"))
  


### OUTPUT:
```
